                <b>The X-Wing</b> is "endless runner" (or "flyer", to be accurate) 
                about one of the most important moments 
                in lifetime of the Galaxy-Far-Far-Away — the Battle of Yavin. 
                During this cruel battle the Rebelion attempted to destroy enormously huge 
                and powerfull weapon of Galactic Empire — 
                the Death Star. And today outcome of the battle depends on <b>you.</b>

                The game concept is similar to other games in "endless runner" genre. Main idea
                of all of them is to avoid obstacles and go further and further. But most of them
                are one-dimensional and don't use all abilities of second dimension. Despite of it,
                the X-Wing game gives to player breathtaking gameplay in two axes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course there are truly exciting obstacles, which are generated procedurally.
                Also controls haven't ever been simplier than now — just move your mouse to point
                where you would like to see the starfighter.

                The game was created with great help of WebGL technology. Of course vanilla
                WebGL is not as easy-to-use as I would like. So because of interest to 
                voxel graphics and this graphic language I decided to use THREE.JS library,
                that great for all kinds of 3D experience in Web. Also HTM5 audio API appeared to
                be very usefull.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other technologies are great too, but more ordinary: of course ES6, HTML5 and CSS3.
                Like it should be in 2017 :)
